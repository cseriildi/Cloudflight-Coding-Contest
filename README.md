# Cloudflight Coding Contest

This repository contains my solutions to challenges from the [Cloudflight Coding Contest](https://codingcontest.org/).

> The Cloudflight Coding Contest is a multi-level programming challenge open to participants worldwide. Each contest presents unique problems designed to test problem-solving skills, efficiency, and creativity. Each contest has a theme, and the tasks get progressively harder at each level. Contestants have 4 hours to work and pass as many levels as they can.
